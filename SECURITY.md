## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of TwelveData Java Client seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Reporting Process

1. **Do not create a public GitHub issue** for the vulnerability
2. **Email us directly** at [INSERT SECURITY EMAIL]
3. **Include detailed information** about the vulnerability:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Include in Your Report

- **Vulnerability Type**: What kind of security issue is it?
- **Affected Component**: Which part of the codebase is affected?
- **Severity**: How critical is this vulnerability?
- **Proof of Concept**: Can you demonstrate the vulnerability?
- **Environment**: What versions/OS/environment were you using?

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution**: Depends on severity and complexity

### Security Best Practices

When using this library, please follow these security guidelines:

#### API Key Security

- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- **Use environment variables** or secure configuration management
- **Rotate API keys** regularly
- **Use least privilege** - only grant necessary permissions

#### Network Security

- **Use HTTPS** for all API communications
- **Validate SSL certificates** (enabled by default)
- **Use secure connection timeouts**
- **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse

#### Data Handling

- **Validate all input data** before processing
- **Sanitize output data** to prevent injection attacks
- **Log sensitive data carefully** - avoid logging API keys or personal information
- **Use secure random number generators** when needed

### Known Security Considerations

#### Rate Limiting

The TwelveData API has rate limits. This client includes built-in handling for rate limit errors, but you should:

- Implement appropriate retry logic
- Monitor your API usage
- Handle `RateLimitException` gracefully

#### Error Handling

- Always handle exceptions properly
- Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
- Log errors appropriately without revealing internal details

### Security Updates

We regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities. To stay secure:

1. **Keep dependencies updated** - Use Dependabot or similar tools
2. **Monitor security advisories** - Check for updates regularly
3. **Test thoroughly** - Verify updates don't break your application
4. **Use the latest stable version** - Always use the most recent release

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

- **Private reporting** - Report vulnerabilities privately first
- **Coordinated disclosure** - Work together on fixes
- **Credit acknowledgment** - We'll credit security researchers appropriately
- **No retaliation** - We welcome security research and won't take action against researchers

### Security Contacts

- **Security Email**: [INSERT SECURITY EMAIL]
- **PGP Key**: [INSERT PGP KEY IF AVAILABLE]
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use GitHub's security advisory feature

### Security Acknowledgments

We thank the security researchers and community members who help keep this project secure by reporting vulnerabilities and contributing to security improvements.
